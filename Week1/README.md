## Week 1

In this week, A Web API is designed that performs CRUD operations using HTTP methods. This is a RESTful service that we can delete and update. 

<b> Web API </b> as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol. It is a concept and not a technology. We can build Web API using different technologies. Web API is a RESTFull service technology. It is platform independent and a Web Api service can support multiple data formats and multiple platforms. It is the best choice for developing REST-ful services because it is HTTP-based. 

<b> REST </b>  stands for "Representational State Transfer". It is a service structure used for faster and more practical communication between the client-server (the user and the server). REST carries out data transport operations such as JSON or XML in order to perform application communications between client-server. REST architecture basically supports Get, Post, Put, Delete and similar methods, which can be done simply with HTTP requests without the need for a proxy. 

<b> RESTful </b> is a web service with certain principles developed based on the REST architecture. The data between Client-Server is platform independent and with little load. The most used data formats for response are JSON (Javascript Object Notation) and XML (Extensible Markup Language).

In this assignment, I designed a web api called <b> Meetcat </b>, which is a social dating platform for cats. This web service is a Restful service. It contains CRUD operations.

### CRUD Operations

- <b> Create: </b> corresponds to Http verb <b> POST </b>
- <b> Read: </b> corresponds to Http verb <b> GET </b>
- <b> Update: </b> corresponds to Http verb <b> PUT </b>
- <b> Delete: </b> corresponds to Http verb <b> DELETE </b>
